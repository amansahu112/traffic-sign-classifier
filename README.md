# traffic-sign-classifier
 This project focuses on the former: To develop a neural network that reads traffic signs and classifies them correctly. These are the steps I followed to accomplish the task: Explore and Visualize the dataset Pre-process and augment the dataset, if needed Develop a CNN model Train and validate the model Optimize the model by experimenting with different hyper-parameters Test the model with the test dataset
